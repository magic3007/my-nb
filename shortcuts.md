## Readline

```bash
# C: Ctrl
# M: Alt

C-b       # move backward one character
C-f       # move forward one character
M-b       # move backward one word
M-f       # move forward on word
C-a       # move to the begin of the line
C-e       # move to the end of the line
  
C-d       # delete character forward
backspace # delete character backward 

C-k       # kill (to clipboard) to the end of line
C-u       # kill (to clipboard) to the beginning of line

# Note: Although GNU readline maintains a kill ring (clipboard), 
# works much like Emacs’s kill ring, it’s not shared with 
# your system’s clipboard, nor any other instances of GNU readline. 
# It is, in effect, local to the process you’re running.
